IAAS:
	Migrating existing workload to Cloud
		 
	

	Company	would decided 
		We already have application developed -----LOB (line of Business)
		We already have servers built--------------databse servers, web servers, etc.
		We aleary have customers, data inplace-----Customer base, business applications
		we already have our Development Team-------Systems Engineers ( Dev)
		we already have our IT Management Team-----Sytem Adminitrators( IT pros)


	Infrastructure As A Service  ( Cloud)
		Can we just consume Elastic Computing from Cloud Provider
		Can we Create and deploy our servers to Virtualization Enviornment provided by Cloud provider

		
	 We just need  Online Infrastructure on Rental basis
	 It this thing is really your requirement

		Then subscribe to  Cloud

			AWS-------public cloud
			azure-------public cloud
			GCP-------public cloud
		
		If you want to subscribe to Cloud
			first try for Free tier Access

	Each Cloud provider provides Free Tier access for certain duration
		Even student, Individual or a company can subscribe to Cloud as free tier access.


	EC2 Instance  ( virtual machines)
		
	Online Application Deployment
	Invoking Cloud hosted online Application remotely from any client browser



If that company already have their servers built, what are they actually using from IaaS ??
