Introduction:
This project aims to solve the problem of tracking and accountability of vehicles by providing a software platform.
This project would serve as an important step to help in Vehicle tracking, component monitoring, vehicle analysis and Ration
management.
 An efficient vehicle tracking system is implemented for monitoring of any equipped vehicle from any location at any time with 
the help of Global Positioning System (GPS) and Arduino Board which will enable users to locate their vehicles with ease and
 in a convenient manner. This web application will provide a dashboard for better and easy understanding of their vehicle positions 
and related statistics.
The core function of our project is to develop a tracking system that is cost-effective so we have made use of the following 
components that have effective operation and usage. 

Initially, we worked on getting geo coordinates i.e. latitude and longitude and for this, 
we made use of the GPS module to capture location, speed and time of last received data in accordance. 


Here, the GPS receiver receives the location data like latitude and longitude of a vehicle and send them by using 
an HTTP request to web server. The browser is used to load the PHP web page which contains Google maps to show the 
location of the vehicle in real time. The web page containing the map directly marks the coordinates, as it arrives, 
without reloading the page. That means, in real time, we get to see the location of the vehicle.
                         
Geofencing is one of the important features of our project. As the problem statement stated that driver may take a longer route 
to increase fuel consumption and ask for more money for his long journey or the driver unintentionally took the wrong path,
 such scenario affects the throughput of the journey. It also affects the performance of vehicle and driver. 
Thus, the geofencing is applied.
Geofencing is the virtual boundary to the optimized path from source to destination which is defined at the time of journey creation.
It is a radius which user have to input in meters. Whenever vehicle deviates from its optimized path and the deviation is more than 
the defined radius then it means itâ€™s a geofencing break, which results in a notification popup generated on the screen. 
This helps user to know that geofencing is broken by this vehicle.
